I refuse to waste time telling a bunch of useless facts about myself.  Instead, I aim to give a taste of the real me; the person who might be in the next office at work. 
      </p>  
      <p> 
I am building a foundation for my own family.  I in general like to consider myself a home body.  Although I may have quite the attitude, I can be a really nice person that is great to have as a friend.  I am getting married and buying a house, very soon.  I have one child, however that topic is quite complicated and best for another time.  One of my top priorities in life is animals.  I love most animals, some, like snakes, I will scream like a girl over.  However, dogs, cats, and other little buddies just make my day.  I would love to one day run some sort of animal rescue during my career known as life.  You might like me, you might now.  You won't know till you get to know me, so why wait?

Since this is not a personal blog, I will let you all continue on with the intention of this website. Please take a look at my resume and portfolio of some of my favorite projects to date and if you have any questions, contact me through any of the listed methods in Contact Info.
